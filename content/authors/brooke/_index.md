Hello! My name is Brooke and I'm a senior CS student here at UCF. I really love linguistics, and I'm interested in doing research in computational linguistics in grad school. Last summer, I was part of an Automated Narrative Generation (computer storytelling!) research team in Ilmenau, Germany, which culminated in a published paper. In my free time, I love rock climbing, traveling, playing piano, baking, and learning new languages (right now, I'm self-studying Japanese!). I'm also a huge font nerd :)

Feel free to reach out to me with any questions about sponsoring the club or partnering with us; or, if you're a student, please let me know if you have any questions about getting involved with research or TAing!
