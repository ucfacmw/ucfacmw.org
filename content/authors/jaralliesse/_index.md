Hiya! :waving_hand: I'm Jaralliesse and I'm currently the Secretary of ACM & ACM-W at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) for the 2022 - 2023 academic year! :muscle::triumph:

I have a variety of interests but I enjoy trying new things! This year I'll be participating in the NASA Student Launch :rocket:
