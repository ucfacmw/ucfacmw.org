Hiya! :waving_hand: I'm Jaralliesse and I'm currently the Secretary of ACM & ACM-W at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/) for the 2022 - 2023 academic year! :muscle::triumph:

I have a variety of interests but I enjoy trying new things! This year I'm trying to learn rocketry and crocheting. Some of my hobbies include reading and playing video games, I also occasionally do commissions on the side for art.

As of right now, I am currently working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for this semester.
