Hey there! :waving_hand: I'm Chloë and I'm currently the President of ACM & ACM-W at the [University of Central Florida](https://www.ucf.edu/). Last year, I was the Secretary and the Mentorship Director for ACM-W. :relaxed:

On another note, I'm also the current Vice President of [AI@UCF](https://ucfai.org)! :robot:
