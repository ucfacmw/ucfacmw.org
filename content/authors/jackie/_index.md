Hello! I was a former member and sponsorship director of UCF's ACM-W. I graduated from UCF in December 2019 and am currently working as a software developer. I was a member of ACM-W at its founding so while I may not be a student anymore, feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn if you ever have any questions! I'm always happy to connect with others in the UCF community.
