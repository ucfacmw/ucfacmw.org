Hi there! Iâ€™m Emilia and I am the ACM-W VP this year ðŸ’œ I hope to rally all of UCFâ€™s women/non-binary people in tech and form a super strong unit of support, allyship, and achievement for us all. Also, I work for the Office of Student Involvement as a web designer, and I am an RA at Knightscircle so consider me your design-tech-knowledgable-older-sister-who-is-looking-out-for-you.
Fun Fact: I pulled off getting a national award in game design for something I made in Scratch ðŸ™€
