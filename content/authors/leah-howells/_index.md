Hi everyone! I’m Leah Howells and I am your Secretary this year :D I’ve been a part of ACM/ACM-W for about a year now and am super excited to be working with this year's leadership to help make the club the best it can be. I am also part of the KnightHacks dev team and am participating in UCF’s REU program in Computer Vision this summer.
Fun fact: I used to play the trombone and I have a cat named Lily who has extra toes :)
