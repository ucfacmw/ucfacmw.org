Hey there! I’m Melanie, the Marketing Director for ACM and ACM-W. I’m also the Communications Director of KnightHacks and a researcher at the STIR lab! I enjoy meeting new people and helping others get involved in the field of computer science. Also, I love video games, shows, and music.

Fun Fact: I can play the flute (I have marched in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade) and I can speak Spanish!
