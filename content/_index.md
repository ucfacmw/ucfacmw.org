              <p class="card-text text-center"> ACM & ACM-W at UCF organizes and promotes group activities, such as
                visits to computer-related businesses, conferences, and museums. During our GBMs we discuss relative
                political issues regarding computing, have guest speakers/lecturers, promote internships and co-ops
                within computer science, as well as whiteboard code/pair program. These activities are intended not only
                to further our knowledge of computer systems, but also help us build a cohesive community of computing
                enthusiasts.</p>
              <p class="card-text text-center"> ACM & ACM-W at UCF also periodically invites guest speakers to make
                presentations at UCF for our collective enrichment. ACM & ACM-W members are encouraged to attend these
                presentations, as are any interested community members. Members are also encouraged to reach out if they
                desire a specific speaker to come to UCF!</p>
