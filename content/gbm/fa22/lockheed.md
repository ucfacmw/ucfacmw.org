abstract: "For this GBM we'll be hosting a presentation a fellow ACM member who's currently working on the college recruitment team at Lockheed Martin. If you're interested in learning more about what interns / employees at one of the largest Defense companies in the country do, how their paid College Work Experience Program (CWEP) works, or what recruiters are looking for in internship applications, swing by The Tech Commons.
Afterwards, we'll do a quick overview of what the typical Software Engineering Intern hiring process looks like in terms of stages and offer QA as far as what you can expect!"
