A rock-paper-scissor app where the user can play against the computer using the camera by capturing hand gestures from the user.

## Potential Future Updates
The idea can also evolve to be able to interpret American Sign Language, eventually becoming an ASL learning tool to practice and teach with. This could also help scuba diving teams to practice their underwater safety hand gestures.
