Ozone is a Discord Bot whose main purpose is to manage your notifications from other server's announcements to save you time when you get on to check them. The hope is when a user opens Discord, they can go to their personalized channel and are able to see what new events are happening. This will be done by setting up a server and feeding other server's announcements into separate channels, and we will be using a few of the UCF clubs to get it running. Then, it’s the bot’s job to essentially funnel the information from those channels and send them messages into their inbox (kinda like email filtering into folders). We believe the base of Ozone must be a notification assistant bot that can be personalized to anyone's needs quickly and effectively.

## Future Potential Updates
If we finished that we could go so far as to make Ozone be able to input events into a Google Calendar or send texts to the user's phone via Discord to alert them that there is an event coming up. More suggestions may be added in the future.
